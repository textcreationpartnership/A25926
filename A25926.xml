            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel, Thomas Walcot, John Rouſe,</hi> and <hi>William Hone,</hi> having been Convicted of High Treaſon, for Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Death of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were this 14th of <hi>July</hi> brought into the Court to receive Sentance of Death; and the Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> being ſet before the Bar, the Clerk demanded (ſeeing he was found Guilty of High-Treaſon, and by the Law ought to dye) what he had to ſay, why Judgement ſhould not paſs againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which he replyed, That he did not conceive a deſign to Leavy War was a direct intent to Murther the King, with which in the Indictment he was charged, and therefore deſired that his Indictment might be read, which was by the Court accordingly granted: After which he declared, that he had been informed, that Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
<pb facs="tcp:48527:1"/>of War did not comprehend the killing of the King; to which the Court replyed, that the Verdict had paſſed, and that, both the Court and his Lordſhip were bound by Law to ſtand to, as not being in their power to alter; and that ſeeing it was the Kings pleaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Judgement by his Attorney General, it was the part of the Court to give that Judgement as the Law had allotted for Crimes of that nature, deſiring him to think of another ſtate; and Mr. Attorney openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Judgement, Mr. Recorder in the name of the Court pronounced the Sentance, That He <hi>William Ruſſell</hi> Eſq; ſhould be lead to the place from whence he came, and from thence be drawn upon a Hurdle to the place of Execution, and there to be Hanged up by the Neck, then to be cut down alive, his Bowels to be taken out, and his Privy-Members to be cut off and burned before his Face, his Head to be ſeverred from his Body, and his Body to be devided in four quarters, and to be diſpoſed of at the pleaſure of the King: After which, his Lordſhip returned to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Thomas Wallcot, William Hone,</hi> and <hi>John Rouſe</hi> were ſet to the Bar, and in like manner demanded what they could ſay in ſtay of Execution? Upon which the two former, <hi>viz. Wallcot</hi> and <hi>Hone</hi> deſired only that their Friend might come freely to viſit them, which by the Court was granted; after which <hi>Hone</hi> deſired time to Repent. The latter, <hi>viz. Rouſe,</hi> made a long preamble, but to no purpoſe. After which, Mr. Recorder paſſed the ſame Sentance upon them as had paſſed upon the Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> earneſtly admoniſhing, that as their Crimes were great, and of the higheſt nature, that ſo their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance might be accordingly.</p>
            <p>Sentance paſſed, they returned from whence they came, to expect the juſt reward of their Treaſon.</p>
